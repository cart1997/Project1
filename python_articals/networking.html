    - The routing is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks. <br>
    <br>
    - The principles of routing can apply to any type of network, from telephone networks to public transportation. In packet-switching networks, such as the Internet, routing selects the paths for Internet Protocol (IP) packets to travel from their origin to their destination. <br><br>
    - Reliability (computer networking) Jump to navigation Jump to search. In computer networking, a reliable protocol provides notifications to the sender as to the delivery of transmitted data, as opposed to an unreliable protocol, which does not provide assurance of the delivery of data to the intended recipient(s).
