<article> -	â€¢	HTTP is an application protocol that dictates how the information on the World Wide Web travels, whereas HTML dictates how the Web pages are formatted and displayed. <br>
    <br> -  HTTP is the system that tells Web data how to go from one place to another, while HTML is the language in which Web pages are written.
    <br> <br>
    - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. <br>
    <br>
    - Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website.
    <br><br>
    - HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider.
